# Animal Memory Game - Milestone Two Project

You can view the finished website [here](https://lawlessxd.github.io/animal-game/index.html)!

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive front-end website that responds to user actions. I decided to create a memory game where the player would have to match two animals, a parent and a child by turning over two cards. If the player turns a card with a Cow, the corresponding matching card is a card with a Calf.

The memory game is a single page design using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap technologies learned throughout the Full Stack Web Developer course with Code Institute.

The images are randomly positioned at the beginning of each game.
