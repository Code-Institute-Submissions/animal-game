# Animal Memory Game - Milestone Two Project

You can view the finished website [here](https://lawlessxd.github.io/animal-game/index.html)!

***

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive front-end website that responds to user actions. The website is a single page design using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap technologies learned throughout the Full Stack Web Developer course with Code Institute.

I decided to create a memory game where the player would have to match two animals, a parent and a child by turning over two cards. 

For example:

![Parent](https://github.com/LawlessXD/animal-game/blob/master/assets/images/cow.png "Cow"){: width=150 height=100}
![Child](https://github.com/LawlessXD/animal-game/blob/master/assets/images/calf.png "Calf"){: width=150 height=100}
